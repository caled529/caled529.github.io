    <h1>Hi, my name is Cale, and this is my <i>cool</i> website!</h1>
    <p>
      In the future, I'll be playing around with this website in order to learn
      HTML, CSS, and possibly more powerful backend things using JS and Python.
      I also plan to use this site as a portfolio containing programming
      projects I am proud of and/or currently working on.
