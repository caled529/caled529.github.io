        <h1>Hi, my name is Cale, and this is my <i>cool</i> website!</h1>
        <p>
            In the future, I'll be playing around with this website in 
            order to learn HTML, CSS, and possibly more powerful backend 
            things using JS and Python. I also plan to use this site as 
            a portfolio containing programming projects I am proud of 
            and/or currently working on.
