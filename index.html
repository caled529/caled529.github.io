  <h2>Hi, my name is Cale, and this is my website!</h2>
  <p>
    In the future, I'll be playing around with this website in order to learn
    HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript too. I also plan to use this site as a
    portfolio containing programming projects I am proud of and/or currently
    working on. <br>
    <br>
    In the meantime, check out some of my projects
    <a href=https://github.com/caled529>
      over here on GitHub!
